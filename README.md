# 07-terraform-03-basic
# Домашнее задание к занятию "3. Основы и принцип работы Терраформ"

## Задача 1. Создадим бэкэнд в S3 (необязательно, но крайне желательно).

## Задача 2. Инициализируем проект и создаем воркспейсы. 
В виде результата работы пришлите:
* Вывод команды `terraform workspace list`.
```bash
 terraform workspace list
  default
* prod
  stage
```  
* Вывод команды `terraform plan` для воркспейса `prod`.  
```bash
terraform plan
